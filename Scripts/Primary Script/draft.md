# Primary Script Draft
Did you know, after testing, several homes in the Williamsburg Area were found to have radon levels so high, it was equal to lung cancer risk of smoking over 2 packs of cigarettes, per day? In fact, radon is the second most common cause of lung cancer in the United States. And you may not even know you or your family have been exposed, as this invisible, odorless, tasteless gas may not cause immediate side-effects. In this video, you’ll learn about what radon is, why we should care about it, and how you can take action against radon in your home.

## HEALTH CONCERN
Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that can enter your home through multiple points, including vents, cracks in your walls, floors, or foundation; crawl spaces; construction joints; and water supply. The highest levels are usually found in the lowest living areas of a home.

## BACKGROUND & RESEARCH
So where does radon come from? The ground below our feet is composed of massive layers of rock. In Williamsburg, one of these layers consists of a porous rock called the Yorktown formation. Over millions of years, uranium built up within the Yorktown foundation. Uranium naturally decays into radon, which is able to escape between the cracks in rocks and travel up to the surface.

## WHO NEEDS TO KNOW
If your house is built on or near the Yorktown formation, there could be radon seeping into your basement or crawlspace. Residents, landlords, and realtors should all be aware of this risk, and given the resources they need to detect and mitigate radon if it is present.

## WHAT CAN YOU DO
If you have a radon problem, it’s essential you take immediate action. But rest assured, there are affordable and effective solutions. Follow these four steps.

1. Follow the link in the description below to view the online, interactive radon risk map of Williamsburg, created by the William & Mary Department of Geology. It can help you quickly determine if your home is on or near the Yorktown Formation.

2. If your home is in the moderate to high risk areas, obtain a radon test kit. Testing your home for radon is easy, and just takes a few minutes. The Virginia Department of Health has short-term radon detection kits available for just $3, including shipping. To order a kit, visit vdhradon.org. This link is also included in the description below.

3. If you do detect radon in your home, you will want to hire a professional immediately. The National Radon Proficiency Program and National Radon Safety Board both have directories of radon detection and mitigation professionals. This information can also be found at vdhradon.org.
