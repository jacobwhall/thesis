<p>Radon is a chemical element with the atomic number 86.
It occurs naturally as a short intermediate step in uranium decay chains (Figure 1).
It has three isotopes: <sup>219</sup>Rn, <sup>220</sup>Rn, and <sup>222</sup>Rn <span class="citation">(Weigel, 1978)</span>.
<sup>222</sup>Rn is the most impactful on humans, and the isotope of radon I’ll be referring to for the remainder of this project.
<sup>222</sup>Rn has a half-life of 3.82 days, meaning that after that amount of time half of a given quantity of <sup>222</sup>Rn will have decayed into the next decay product.
The products directly following <sup>222</sup>Rn are solids, and also short-lived.
Two of them, <sup>218</sup>Po and <sup>214</sup>Po, emit alpha particles when they decay.
When <sup>222</sup>Rn is inhaled into the lungs, this process can take place within the lungs.
Alpha particles can damage the cells lining airways within the lungs, eventually leading to cancer.
This is how exposure to radon increases one’s risk of lung cancer <span class="citation">(National Research Council (US) Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiations, 1988)</span>.
Radon exposure is the second-highest cause of lung cancer in the United States, behind smoking tobacco.

>> Cooper's paper had the following quote and citation:
>> "Naturally occuring uranium exists in many soil and rock types...one place [it] can become concentrated is in decayed organic material...(2)"

<p>Concentrations of radon are commonly measured in becquerels per kilogram (Bq/Kg), or picocuries per liter (pCi/L).
Becquerels and curies are both measurements of radioactivity, i.e. they represent the frequency of radioactive decays.
<!-- I prefer becquerels! IDK WHICH ONE TO USE --></p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency’s published radon risk map shows Virginia’s coastal plain as the lowest-risk region in the state, labeled as “Low Potential (less than 2pCi/L)” <span class="citation">(“Virginia - Radon Zones”)</span>.
The Virginia Department of Health has published the same map on their website <span class="citation">(“Indoor Radon Program – Radiological Health”)</span>.
Someone living in the Williamsburg area who reads this map would likely conclude that their home is at negligible risk of radon exposure.
While this might be true for much of the coastal plain, research has shown there are areas of higher risk that would be colored in red on the aforementioned map.</p>
<p>In 1978, Khandelwal and Singh published a short article in Health Physics sharing that they had discovered radioactivity in whale bone vertebra in the Chesapeake Bay area, including in the Yorktown Formation.
<!-- This feels a little out-of-place. Maybe I could find another source about radioactivity in the Chesapeake? -->
<!-- ALSO, please note @khandelwal_singh78 is added as a nocite so that the paragraph formatting can be as such -->
Research on radon at William &amp; Mary started around 1989 when Jennifer M. Cooper wrote a report about the Yorktown Formation as a potential source of radon in the Williamsburg area <span class="citation">(Cooper, 1989)</span>.
<!-- She discovered a house had 30pCi/L, and even more underneath! -->
She tested a number of different locations in York River State Park, correlating the Yorktown formation with radon emission using her own data.
<!--
"In order for radon gas to be emitted from the ground, a fairly high level of soil permeability must exist (1)"
Lasch, David K, 1988, "On Radon": Virginia Minerals, vol.34, no.1 published by Division of Mineral Resources.
--></p>
<p>The second student at William &amp; Mary to investigate radon was Tracy Whitesell.
Her project involved testing different locations for radon, and she compared different formations by makeup and average radon concentration.
Her results clearly show that the Yorktown has higher radon concentrations than nearby formations.
Whitesell was one of the first to so thoroughly illustrate the radon landscape in the Williamsburg area, and her work was remarkable in confirming the suspicions of previous researchers.
In the final sentence of her thesis, she recommended that “houses built within or on the Yorktown should be tested for radon” <span class="citation">(Whitesell, 1990)</span>.</p>
<!--
Borne (94?) -- summarized earlier work, compared Yorktown Formation to different formation -->
<p>In 2020, Dorian Miller created <a href="https://arcg.is/zHjSG">a “risk map” of radon near William &amp; Mary’s campus</a>.
This map was created by mapping elevation data at certain thresholds, because the Yorktown Formation is a horizontal layer that becomes closer to the surface as the elevation decreases <span class="citation">(Miller, 2021)</span>.</p>

</div>
<p>In 2021, Zoey Mondshine validated the risk map, by testing individual homes and comparing their relative test results to the regions on the risk map.
Among other observations, she identified a home in the “Low Radon Risk” region with radon levels above the EPA’s recommended limit of 4pCi/L <span class="citation">(Mondshine, 2021)</span>.</p>
