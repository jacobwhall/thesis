# Introduction
Radon is a naturally-occuring gas...

## Research Question and/or Hypothesis
Radon can be a real danger, and is something the general public should learn more about. How can radon be communicated to the public most effectively?

# Geologic Setting or Background
* What is radon?
	+ An explanation of what radon is / how it forms
	+ An explanation of how radon can cause cancer

* Overview of prior radon research in Williamsburg
	
	+ Williamsburg has been described as low-risk for radon, which is generally true, but there are areas of high risk 

Research on radon at William and Mary started around 1989 when Jennifer M. Cooper wrote her thesis investigating the Yorktown Formation as a potential source of radon in the Williamsburg area.

her big discovery was that a house had 30 picocuries per Liter, and even more underneath!

The second person to work on this was Tracy Whitesil
