<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Summer 2021</h2>
<p>During , I will reach out to all potential stakeholders, including previous research participants, representatives from the City of Williamsburg, and professors who study science communication.
I will spend the first week compiling a list of stakeholders I should contact, and reviewing it with my advisors.
Over the next couple of weeks, I will write emails to each of the identified stakeholders.
I will describe the ways they can help with this project, including reviewing the script, reviewing the finished video, and helping to share it once it is completed.
During this time I will continue to review literature on radon, with the goal of reading every previous paper about radon from William &amp; Mary.</p>
<p>During , I will write the script.
Doing so will raise questions about geology, filmmaking, and communication that I will research.
The first week I’ll create an outline to review with my advisors Heather, Rick, and Jim.
Then I will flesh out the script into a cohesive story.
I intend to make the script into a complete plan for the video, understanding that adjustments may be made to include interview footage and further research down the road.</p>
<p>I will review the script with stakeholders in .
Everyone who agreed to participate in this project in June will receive a copy of the script, with the invitation to submit feedback.
During these conversations, I will schedule some in-person interviews that will be recorded and included in the video.
By the start of the 2021-2022 school year, I will have completed this review process, and will be ready to begin filming.</p>

<div id="fall-2021" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Fall 2021</h2>
<p>I will have filmed all interviews by the end of .
These will be in-person meetups or recorded video calls with stakeholders who agree to discuss their work on camera.
While I will have scripted questions I bring to these interviews, I will allow each interviewee to share more about themselves and their work.
The equipment I use to film these videos, including cameras, lighting, tripods, and media storage devices, will be borrowed from Reeder Media Center.
It will be important to keep files from each of these interviews organized.
The video files will be kept in labelled folders, and uploaded to a Google Drive folder as backup.</p>
<p>In  I will produce a draft video, collecting any final footage and assembling them into a timeline.
Most of this will happen at the Reeder Media Center, where there is hardware and software available to students for video editing.</p>
<p>During , I will send the draft video to the appropriate stakeholders and have them provide feedback.
I will create a Google Form for them to fill out, with questions about what the liked, and what they think could be improved.
This will also be an opportunity for interviewees to preview their own contributions, and agree to remaining in the finished video.</p>
<p>In  I’ll meet with my advisors again to go over my progress, and we’ll make it clear what still needs to be accomplished.
This meeting will include a review of the feedback I received for my draft film, and collective decision-making about what changes are most important to prioritize in the Spring.</p>
</div>
<div id="spring-2022" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Spring 2022</h2>
<p>In January and February, I will implement whatever changes need to be made to the video based on the feedback from the stakeholders and my advisors.
I will also edit the script to reflect what the video will actually be.</p>
<p>In March and April, I will put any finishing touches on the video, and create captions.</p>
<p>By the W&amp;M Geology Department’s Senior Research Saturday, the video will be completed, and sent to all stakeholders along with the final script and my literature review.</p>
