# Producing a Video to Communicate Radon Health Risks in Williamsburg

⚠️ Under Construction! ⚠️

This repository is where I'm writing my undergraduate thesis! Which is all about communicating about radon in Williamsburg.

I'll update this readme in the future with an overview of the project, but for now this is a place for me to track my own changes, consolidate assets, etc.

## Reading the thesis

_coming soon_

## Rendering the thesis

To render the thesis, you'll need to install Pandoc.
Instructions for doing so are [on the pandoc website](https://pandoc.org/installing.html), but if you use Fedora like me the command is

```
sudo dnf install pandoc
```

(though, the Pandoc package is out of data for Fedora, so I've been installing the [latest release from github](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases))

### Render it as a PDF document

Just run make:
```
make
```

### Render it as an static HTML site

_I am re-working this aspect of my project and will update this section soon._
