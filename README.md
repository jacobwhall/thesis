# Jacob's Senior Thesis

This repository is where I'm writing my senior thesis! Which is all about communicating about radon in Williamsburg.

I'll update this readme in the future with an overview of the project, but for now this is a place for me to track my own changes, consolidate assets, etc.

## Reading the thesis

The thesis is rendered to thesis.pdf

## Rendering the thesis

To render the thesis, you'll need to install R.
Instructions for doing so are [in the R project FAQ](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#How-can-R-be-installed_003f), but if you use Fedora like me the command is

```
sudo dnf install R-core
```

and then you'll have to install the R package RMarkdown.
Within R, that's as easy as:

```
install.packages('rmarkdown')
```

Then, all you need to do is run the following command in this directory:
```
Rscript render.R
```
