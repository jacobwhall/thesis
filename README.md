# Jacob's Senior Thesis

This repository is where I'm writing my senior thesis! Which is all about communicating about radon in Williamsburg.

I'll update this readme in the future with an overview of the project, but for now this is a place for me to track my own changes, consolidate assets, etc.

## Reading the thesis

The thesis is rendered to thesis.pdf

## Rendering the thesis

To render the thesis, you'll need to install R, and then the R package RMarkdown. Then, all you need to do is run "Rscript render.R" in this directory.

## References

I manage my references for this project using Zotero, and export them as a CSL JSON to references.json
